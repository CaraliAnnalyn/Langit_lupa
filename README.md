# 🌤️ Langit–Lupa | A Filipino Tag Game

**Langit–Lupa** is a modern web-based remake of the traditional Filipino children's game *Langit Lupa*.  
Players jump across platforms, avoid lava, and try to tag each other while staying safe on elevated surfaces — just like the original playground classic, now brought to life with JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Node.js Express.

## 🎮 Game Overview

> “Langit–Lupa” is a traditional Filipino game of tag where players are **safe** from being tagged if they stand on an elevated surface (“**Langit**” or heaven),  
> while the player who is “it” remains on the ground (“**Lupa**” or earth).

This web version combines **nostalgia** with **modern design**, featuring pixel-style graphics, smooth animations, and support for both keyboard and mobile controls.
